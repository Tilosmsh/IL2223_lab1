# Iris Titanic as a Serverless ML System

Lab assignment 1 of ID2223 Scalable Machine Learning
and Deep Learning course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

The Titanic dataset is first cleaned with titaniccleaner.py. Then, this service registers the datasets as Feature Groups with
Hopsworks, trains the models and registers the models with Hopsworks, with the codes run on Modal.
The service works as gradio applications on Hugging Face.
